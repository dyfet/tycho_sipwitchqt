.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of swlite-authorize is to manage authorization records for a backend 
sqlite sipwitchqt database.  This includes both creating and removing (or suspending)
authorized users, and also setting the SIP digest password.

If used with no options the current authorization realm is shown.  If a userid is given
then the password to use will be prompted on the console.  If an extension # is given
in front of the user id, then a new user authorization record is created.  Otherwise
options can be used to set digest mode, and whether to suspend or drop a user.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-sha256
Use a SHA-256 digest when setting a password (default is MD5).
.TP
.B \-\-sha512
Use a SHA-512 digest when setting a password (default is MD5).
.TP
.B \-\-drop
Drop (remove) the authorized user and associated extension record.  Any active calls or
registrations should also be terminated.
.TP
.B \-\-suspend
Suspend the users account.  Any active calls and registrations should also be cancelled.
